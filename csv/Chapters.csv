0,The Spotted Turtle,https://www.youtube.com/embed/GVaZmhSoAkg?si=jt6Abgbzf3piWnrk,Youtube: Wondering About Nature,https://www.youtube.com/@Wondering_About_Nature,"The spotted turtle (<i>Clemmys guttata</i>) is a small     semi-aquatic turtle in the Emydidae family.     Spotted turtles are typically found in marshy meadows, vernal pools, swamps, ditches, small ponds,     and streams, where bodies of water are typically clean and shallow with soft bottoms and ample aquatic     vegetation (Beane, 2010; Ernst and Lovich, 2009). Although regarded as a wetland generalist, they exhibit     a strong association with shallow vegetated ephemeral wetland systems characterized by dynamic hydrology.     Globally, spotted turtles are considered endangered according to the International Union     for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, with a fifty percent estimated     reduction in overall population size (van Dijk, 2011), and it is a species of greatest conservation     need in all states where it occurs (Willey et al., 2022). The range of the spotted turtle extends from     southern Ontario and Maine, down the Atlantic Coastal Plain and Piedmont to northern Florida,     and westward through Ontario, New York, Pennsylvania, central Ohio, northern Indiana,     Michigan, and northeastern Illinois (Ernst and Lovich, 2009). Only portions of the range for the conterminous U.S.     are pictured here (<i>see orange marker</i>).",5.0,,,Spotted Turtle Range,39.9526,-75.1652,,,geojson/spotted_range_map.geojson,fillColor:purple;color:black

2,Synergistic Impacts of Urbanization and Climate on Turtle Nests,media/wake_impervious_surface.png,Image Source: USGS - 2024 Annual NLCD,https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/annual-nlcd-fractional-impervious-surface,"Wake County experienced a cumulative population change between 2020 and 2024 of 9.1% U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division, 2025),                                     compared to the national cumulative change of only 2.6% (U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division, 2024).                                     This increase in population brings extensive changes to the landscape, including an increase in impervious surface cover,                                     illustrated here. Urbanization has been attributed to increased surface runoff (Shrestha et al., 2021), and synergistic                                     impacts between climate change and urbanization have the potential to work synergistically to increase the severity                                     of urban flooding (Huong and Pathirana, 2013). There is some evidence that flooding is associated with the                                     loss of nesting area (Norris et al. 2018), direct mortality (Pignati et al. 2013), and developmental stress (Cordero et al. 2017)                                     in freshwater turtles. Despite these impacts, <b>the effects of flooding on spotted turtle nests has been                                     relatively unexplored</b>, despite the fact that spotted turtles typically nest in and around the periphery of wetlands (Willey et al. 2022),                                     areas that likely experience substantial flooding during times of intense rainfall.",9.0,,,"Wake County, NC",35.8032,-78.5661,,,geojson/wake_boundary.geojson,fillColor:pink;color:black

Hurricane Florence made                                     landfall in Wilmington, North Carolina (<i>see marker</i>) on September 14th, 2018 as a category 1                                     storm. Hurricane Florence brought the highest rainfall for any storm to hit the eastern coast of                                     the United States, where Wake County, NC received between 8-10 inches of rainfall (WRAL, 2018).                                     Using this extreme storm event as a case study, we were seeking to <b>(1) determine if extreme                                     flooding events impact areas that could be used by spotted turtles for nesting. (2) If so, is                                     flooding linked to impervious surface cover, and (3) how do trends compare between woody and                                     emergent wetlands as identified through NLCD?</b>",,,Pink,"Wilmington, NC",34.2104,-77.8868,,,,
4,Mapping Pre-Flood Conditions,media/ndwi_img.png,Emma M. Wilson - Analysis Derived from Sentinel-2 (2018) Imagery via GEE,https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/sentinel-2,"We first documented pre-existing bodies of water using the normalized                                     difference water index (NDWI), which ranges from -1 to 1, where higher values are indicative of                                     greater surface water probability (pictured here). This allowed us to determine baseline surface water extent                                     prior to Hurricane Florence. We only considered 50 of the largest woody and emergent (100 total) wetlands, areas that may                                     support spotted turtle nests, in Wake County, NC. All wetlands were buffered by 359 m to capture flooding impacts on nests                                     that may occur outside of the designated NLCD wetland boundary. Green polygons denote wetlands considered                                     in this analysis (selected potential nesting areas).",10.0,,,"Wetlands Sampled in Wake County, NC",35.8032,-78.5661,,,geojson/nesting_combined.geojson,fillColor:green;color:black
5,Exploring Flood Extent,media/flood_extent.png,Emma M. Wilson - Flood Extent Layer Accessed via NC OneMap,https://www.nconemap.gov/datasets/hurricane-florence-flood-extent-across-the-piedmont-and-coastal-plain-of-north-carolina/explore,"In order to determine flood extent, we used an existing dataset that documented flood extent for Hurricane Florence                                     for the Coastal Plain and Piemdont of North Carolina. <i>Flooded areas</i> were defined as new water pixels                                     present in the flood data but <i>not</i> in the pre-flood NDWI data. We only considered areas identified as                                     potential spotted turtle nesting habitat (buffered NLCD wetland polygons)",9.0,,,"Wake County, NC",35.8032,-78.5661,,,geojson/wake_boundary.geojson,fillColor:pink;color:black
6,Impervious Surface Across Wake County,media/impervious_surface_all_subwatersheds.png,Emma M. Wilson,,"Next, to document whether flood extent was connected to impervious surface cover,                                     we identified all subwatersheds (HUC-12 regions) that fall within Wake County, NC.                                     The mean percent impervious surface was calculated for all subwatersheds.                                     Areas in darker red denote higher mean impervious surface, while blue depicts a lower                                     mean impervious surface percent (greys represent intermediate values).",10.0,,,"Sampled Subwatersheds in Wake County, NC",35.8032,-78.5661,,,geojson/subwatersheds_impervious_storymap.geojson,
7,Wetland Flooding,media/proportion_flooded_by_wetland_type.png,Emma M. Wilson,,"We quantified the extent of flooding by calculating the proportion of area that flooded                                     in woody and emergent wetlands. Wetlands in darker red denote more flooded area, while blue depicts a lower                                     proportion of flooded area (greys represent intermediate values).",10.0,,,"Proportion of Wetland Flooded in Wake County, NC",35.8032,-78.5661,,,geojson/flood_with_impervious_storymap.geojson,
8,Emergent Wetland Correlation,media/emergent_wetlands_correlation.png,Emma M. Wilson,,"To determine if flooding was associated with impervious surface, we calculated a correlation metric ranging from -1 to 1,                                     where the sign (-/+) indicates the directionality and the value represents the magnitude of the association.                                     The Pearson correlation coefficient between the proportion of flooded area and mean impervious surface was <b>-0.07</b>.",,,,,,,,,,
9,Woody Wetland Correlation,media/woody_wetlands_correlation.png,Emma M. Wilson,,The correlation was also explored specifically for woody wetlands. The Pearson correlation coefficient                                     between mean impervious surface and proportion of flooded area for woody wetlands was <b>0.34</b>.,,,,,,,,,,
10,Main Takeaways,media/spotted_turtle.jpg,Emma M. Wilson,,"We can see that the area around potential <b>spotted turtle nesting habitat is impacted by flooding</b> from                                     extreme storm events like Hurricane Florence. While woody wetlands were more common in the county, there was                                     significant difference in the proportion of flooded area between woody and emergent wetlands. While there was no,                                     correlation between emergent wetland flooding and mean subwatershed impervious surface, <b>woody wetlands were                                     weakly positively correlated with flooding<b>, suggesting that as impervious surface increases flooding may increase                                     as well. This analysis highlights the need to better understand nest site selection, behavioral adaptations, and                                     nest flood tolerance for spotted turtle conservation in a highly urban area.",,,,,,,,,,
